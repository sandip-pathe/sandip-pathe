### What I Build

**Systems engineer** focused on AI orchestration, human-in-the-loop workflows, and production reliability. Former researcher (IEEE published), current founder building compliance infrastructure for regulated industries.

I ship products that handle real user data in environments where errors have consequences.

**Current focus:**
- **Anaya:** Multi-agent document intelligence for legal contracts. Built with confidence-based routing to prevent AI hallucinations in high-stakes decisions.
- **Workflow orchestration:** Durable execution patterns (Temporal, Redis) for long-running async processes that survive failures.
- **Research:** Applied neural networks to satellite imagery (PolSAR classification). Published at IEEE IGARSS 2024.

### Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**Backend:** FastAPI, Node.js, Event-Driven Architecture  
**AI Systems:** LangChain, RAG, Multi-Agent Orchestration  
**Infrastructure:** Temporal Cloud, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native
